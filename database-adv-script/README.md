# 0. Write Complex Queries with Joins

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on mastering **SQL JOIN operations** by writing and analyzing queries that combine data from multiple related tables. Understanding how to use joins effectively is crucial for working with relational databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Learn how different types of SQL joins work.
- Retrieve related data from multiple tables efficiently.
- Understand how to include unmatched records using `LEFT JOIN` and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
After completing this project, you will be able to:
- Explain the difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.
- Write SQL queries to join multiple tables.
- Retrieve and interpret results involving matched and unmatched data.

# 1. Practice Subqueries

## 🧠 Objective
The goal of this task is to understand and practice **subqueries** in SQL — both **correlated** and **non-correlated** subqueries.

---

## 📝 Instructions

### 1. Non-Correlated Subquery
Write a query to find all **properties** where the **average rating** is greater than **4.0** using a **subquery**.

#### 💡 Explanation
A **non-correlated subquery** runs independently of the main query.  
It executes first, and the result is then used by the outer query.
